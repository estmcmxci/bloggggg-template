# Bloggggg Site Template

## ⭐️ Start Here

This is a static site template built using Eleventy. It requires Node.js 18, which you can check by running `node --version` in a Terminal. If Node.js isn't installed, you'll need to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) before getting started. Some basic knowledge of Git is also helpful!

This template is a simplified fork from [Nulite](https://github.com/codingpotions/nulite). The instructions below should allow someone with a basic understanding of web development to get the project up and running in approximately one hour.

## Initialization

1. Fork this repo into your own GitHub repository.
2. Clone the repository into a local instance.
3. Open the local instance in your favorite IDE or simply use the Terminal by navigating into the project directory (i.e., `cd bloggggg`).
4. Once in the project directory, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
5. Serve the site locally by running `npm run start` — this will allow you to view updates on your localhost browser.

## Project Structure

1. The `_site` folder contains the files used to serve your blog. Keep this in mind when deploying your site.
2. The `public` folder is where you’ll store your images and other media for your blog, specifically under `images/main` and `images/posts`.
3. The `_data` folder allows you to change site information, including the title and description.
4. The `src` folder is where you can edit features on the website, including your bio, blog title, and footer information.
5. Inside the `src` folder, the `posts` directory is where you will write your blog articles. Keep in mind that these posts are rendered in Markdown, so it helps to be familiar with the format.
